# Problem 1

``` r
check_duplicate_bd <- function(n) {
  # Simulate uniformly distributed birthday with size n
  birthdays <- sample(1:365, n, replace = TRUE)
  # Check duplicate
  return(any(duplicated(birthdays)))
}
#Simulate each size 10000 times
sim_num = 10000
group_size = 2:50
prob = numeric(length(group_size))

for (i in seq_along(group_size)){
  n = group_size[i]
  results = replicate(sim_num, check_duplicate_bd(n))
  prob[i] = mean(results)

In this problem, we simulate a problem to measure the probability of
duplicate birthday among the group of `n` people. According to the plot,
we see a positive relationship between `group_size` and
`probability_of_duplicate_birthday`. The result aligns with our
intuition that with more people in a group, there are more likely to be
people with duplicate birthday.
